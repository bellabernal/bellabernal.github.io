        <p>This first interactive really explored conceptually the concept of limits and constraints. Research of other designers, artists and lessons in class helped to put the understanding of limits and constraints into this small interactive feature. This feature was created using Visual Studio Code, using coding languages such as HTML, CSS# and Javascript. This feature rather explored conceptually the idea of limits and constraints, rather than putting it directly into the technical aspects of the feature. It posed various questions rather than directly presenting an answer or statement to an argument. I think this made the interactive less powerful as the user or audience has to have a lot of prior knowledge in order to fully engage with its concept. It explores the concept of music, and whether limits and constraints dismantle or aid the creative mind. The possibilities of musical compositions are limitless. But when you explore this interactive, you find every note is the same. Can you still create rhythm? Would you consider this to still be a musical composition, even though there is only one note? 

          The stage before creating this interactive, such as the research and ideation was very strong. I even found myself overwhelmed with the amount of information found and ideas I could come up with. Therefore in the coming works, I had planned to focus on a solid idea and expand from it rather than feeling lost amongst the endless possibilities. This would ensure there would be more time for the technical making as this is the stage I needed most improvement in. 
          
          I had developed a great idea of how to conceptually demonstrate the theories and concepts learnt, but lacked the understanding of how I can do this through technical and practical skills. I had hoped to improve my skills in the production stage whether that be within Unity or Visual Studio Code. I think this first interactive took a lot of already known skills- ( specifically within Coding ) rather than challenging myself further in software I was new to such as Unity.

        <h2>PARANOIA</h2>

        <p>In this work we were to express a memory or experience that felt important to us. I decided to focus on an experience and more specifically an emotion that I had felt throughout many memories. 
          I also was hoping to create something that felt relatable, and could be better understood by an audience. For this reason I decided to create an interactive that involved a player character that presented in this case as a white square. 
          This therefore meant it could resemble anyone or anything. The development and research stage of this interactive was very different to the first assignment. This time I focused on one idea, and decided how I could digitally present these certain feelings using certain tools in Unity. For example - how can I represent the feeling of frustration? I can have the player under rain, unable to escape it. 
          This interactive really focused more on improving my skills within Unity. I felt I gained a better understanding- specifically of 2D games, creating platforms, understanding rigid bodies, physics and coding scripts within Unity. I think I felt I had better technically implemented the approaches, philosophies and techniques of the ideas learnt. It was also more exciting and interesting to challenge myself with something entirely new, within a software such as Unity. To further develop this interactive would be to implement more design into the styling, such as having more textures, sound and other interactive elements that I had initially planned to incorporate. I felt now I had a base knowledge of 2D interactives in Unity, I just needed to further develop my skills in order to present them in a more creative and professional manner. Rather than focusing on the interactivity that was made through time spent constructing scripts, I would next time focus more on the aesthetics. For example the visual, auditory and interactive elements that create the mood, style and atmosphere.  
Although many ideas didnt make it into the final interactive due to time constraints and lack of knowledge, I believe this interactive really was a step up from the last.

        <h2>SISTERS UNDER ONE ROOF </h2>
        <p>‘Sisters Under One Roof’ went back to the roots of the idea and development stage. 
          I really wanted to portray something that felt super important to me, but again was relatable just like my last interactive. 
          Although this interactive needed the background story to ultimately provide the full understanding of this relationship I was trying to explain, I think it presented it in a super creative manner.
           It is super minimal, but the title is almost all you truly need to gauge the memory I was trying to express. This interactive explores the relationship I had with my sister when we were younger living in the same family home. 
           I think the interactive parts of this project really related and expressed micro-games. This idea of enemy and player, being chased and an ultimate goal. I enjoyed how this interactive made you as the player feel, it really had this sense of stress when you came close to the ‘sister’ 
           in her bedroom. I think this project has implemented the idea of objectives quite clearly. Id say the objective is fuzzy at first, but often this makes the outcome more rewarding, since it models real situations better. The more defined objectives are, the easier it becomes for an audience or use to participate. Therefore perhaps for future making, applying more subtle prompts would really make this feel like a microgame. 
          Ideas like, perhaps a count, timer or sound effect that helped in understanding the concept better.

        <h2>LOS COMMON PHRASES </h2>
        <p>
          This interactive was about exploring microgames further, by adding clear aspects that were clear objectives rather than fuzzy ones. I also got to focus on colour, layout and aesthetic design a lot more than interactivity which felt like an improvement in my overall understanding of how to make an engaging interactive. Unfortunately this project lacked creativity conceptually, although all my other projects had a clear conceptual base, this project got lost in being too similar to things that are out there already. The idea came from memory of learning a new language, being bilingual and enjoying learning languages through games. This could have been implemented better in a more creative way, rather than basing the interactions of the already known matching games. An occuring theme in all my projects has been the use of minimal aesthetics and a soft colour palette, which I think is clear and reflected in this interactive. You can clearly see the connection between the keyboard and this interactive in terms of colour palette, forms and shapes. I enjoy using pastel, warm and soft colours as well as creating most forms with rounded and smooth edges.

        <h2>PASSWORD LOCKED</h2>
        <p>
          Password locked was brought about from a dream I had as a child, reflecting the cemented door with pad-lock that no person can access.
           I wanted to construct the exact dream I had digitally using approaches and techniques taken from lessons learnt in class. Although this interactive did come across like most downloaded asset packages, it did exactly match my dream. I think I created an interesting user perspective, something that I hadn’t experimented with before. As well as the space being a 3D environment, rather than 2D which was also something new and exciting to try out. I also was able to finally incorporate sound into a project, which was something I had always wanted to figure out. It was also feedback I had been given in previous projects, so I had that as a goal. I think the audio is very engaging, and jarring, it captures the audience and gives them an uneasy feeling which was the aim. This interactive promotes thinking, it asks the user to wonder what is the password? Where does this door lead to ? Why can’t I get the password right? I think this interactive would have reached its full potential, with more use of sound, materials and textures. Although it is a 3D environment it does feel flat, and needs more 3D elements for the user to interact with. The interaction itself was a little unusual, and perhaps could have been better implemented. It is still minimal, 
          which a soft colour palette and interactivity that encourages the user to be aware which is something that is noticed across all my works.
